<h1>no-shake-scrollify</h1>

Define waiting time in ms with `var throttleTime = yourWaitingTime`.

Define the elements to scroll to with `var scrollToElement = yourElement`.

Define the element's parent with `var containerElement = yourContainer`.

The container *needs* `overflow-y: hidden;` and `position:relative`.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
